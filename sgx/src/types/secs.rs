    /// Returns the maximum enclave size for 64bit in bytes.

    /// For more on CPUID enumeration leaves, see 37.7.2 and Table 37-4.

    /// # Safety
    /// This function is technically unsafe because it does not check if the
    /// `CPUID` instruction is available before issuing it. This could result
    /// in a crash on some very old CPUs. However, the only modern context
    /// where it could crash is environments like SGX or some virtualized
    /// CPUs. But even in these contexts, it is common to trap and emulate the
    /// instruction.
    ///
    /// Therefore, it is common practice to ignore the test to see if the
    /// `CPUID` instruction is available and just issue it anyway. For this
    /// reason, we are marking this function as safe. For more background to
    /// the state of `CPUID` in Rust, see:
