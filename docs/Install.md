# Installation Guide

## Introduction

Enarx currently has support for Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP. Please check the [Requirements](#requirements).

In the [Initial Setup](#initial-setup) section, you'll find instructions on how to install dependencies for Fedora, CentOS/Stream, and Debian/Ubuntu, including Rust and the toolchains.

Next, you'll find instructions on how to [install Enarx](#installing-enarx) from crates.io, GitHub, or Nix.

Finally, in the [Running Enarx](#running-enarx) section, you'll build and run your first `Hello World` WebAssembly module in Enarx.

## Requirements

### Recommended hardware

Enarx requires specific hardware to run, namely a CPU with a supported Trusted Execution Environment. Currently, Enarx has support for Intel SGX and AMD SEV-SNP.

For Intel, our recommendation would be the 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Ice Lake. This [article](https://www.servethehome.com/3rd-gen-intel-xeon-scalable-ice-lake-sku-list-and-value-analysis/) provides a comprehensive analysis of the different models. The 5318Y or 5318S provide good value.

For AMD our recommendation would be the EPYC 7003 Milan. This [article](https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7003-milan-sku-list-and-value-analysis/) offers an analysis of the different models. The 7313 seems like a good value.

### Setting up an SGX machine
- Run a recent kernel with SGX support compiled in
- Set the SGX device node permissions

```sh:sgx;
$ sudo groupadd -r sgx_prv
$ sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-sgx.rules" <<EOF
SUBSYSTEM=="misc", KERNEL=="sgx_provision", MODE="0660", GROUP="sgx_prv"
SUBSYSTEM=="misc", KERNEL=="sgx_enclave", MODE="0666"
EOF
```


#### Hardware requirements for SGX
- Is there IPMI support?
  - There is a similar technology called Intel AMT ([ref1](http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2013/12/why-i-returned-all-of-my-i3-intel-nucs.html), [ref2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000026592/technologies.html)) that is present on NUCs with `i5` Ivy Bridge processors. 
  - Running an [AMT check](https://github.com/mjg59/mei-amt-check) produces the result `Error: Management Engine refused connection. This probably means you don't have AMT`
- Are there other NUC models that support SGX2?
- Are SGX features accessible from a VM?
  - There is some [experimental support](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/sgx-virtualization) for this

### Setting up an SEV-SNP machine
- install an [SEV-SNP patched kernel](https://github.com/AMDESE/linux/tree/sev-snp-part2-v5)

```sh:snp;ID=fedora
$ sudo dnf copr enable -y harald/kernel-snp 
$ sudo dnf install -y kernel{,-core,-modules}-5.14.0-0.rc2.28.sev.snp.part2.v5.fc34.x86_64
```

- Update the machine to the latest BIOS and/or install the [latest firmware](https://developer.amd.com/sev/):

```sh:snp;
$ wget -O amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/plain/amd/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin?h=20220209"
$ sudo mv amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin /lib/firmware/amd/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin
$ sudo chown root:root /lib/firmware/amd/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin
```

- Set SEV device node permissions

```sh:snp;
$ sudo bash -c "echo 'KERNEL=="sev", MODE="0666"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/50-sev.rules"
```
- Increase the memlock limit for SEV keeps (need to pin a large number of pages)

```sh:snp;
$ sudo bash -c "echo '* - memlock 8388608' > /etc/security/limits.d/sev.conf"
```
- Enable SEV

```sh:snp;
$ sudo bash -c "echo 'options kvm_amd sev=1' > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-amd.conf"
```

### Requirements for KVM as a backend

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.

It's not always possible to have access to hardware with the support for Intel SGX or AMD SEV-SNP, hence, enarx supports KVM to facilitate the testing on more common hardware which have virtualization support. For the KVM support, the Intel VT and AMD-V features must be provided by the hardware.

KVM module is loaded by the Linux kernel automatically if the hardware supports the feature, hence, it's easy for anyone to set it up.

To check if the kvm module is loaded use the following command:
```sh:kvm;ID=debian ID=ubuntu
lsmod | grep kvm
```

If the module is loaded the following output should be expected
```console
kvm_intel    213   0
kvm 	      10   1 kvm_intel
```
or
```console
kvm_amd    23213   0
kvm 	      10   1 kvm_amd
```

## Initial Setup

### Install Dependencies

Please find instructions for each Linux distribution below:

#### Fedora

```sh:ID=fedora
$ sudo dnf update -y
$ sudo dnf install -y git curl gcc pkg-config openssl-devel musl-gcc
```

#### CentOS 8 / Stream
```sh:CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:centos:centos:8"
$ sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
$ sudo dnf copr -y enable ngompa/musl-libc
$ sudo dnf install -y git curl gcc-toolset-11 openssl-devel musl-gcc
$ source "/opt/rh/gcc-toolset-11/enable"
```
:::note

You may want to add that final `source` command to a `~/.profile`,
`~/.bashrc` / or `~/.bash_profile` equivalent, otherwise you must remember
to source that file prior to building `enarx`.

:::

#### CentOS 7 / Scientific Linux 7 and other clones
```sh:CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:centos:centos:7"
$ sudo yum install -y centos-release-scl-rh
```
or search for the package on https://centos.pkgs.org/ and install it manually with, for example:
```console
$ sudo yum install http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/centos-release-scl-rh-2-3.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
```
and then:
```sh:CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:centos:centos:7"
$ sudo yum install -y yum-plugin-copr    
$ sudo yum copr -y enable ngompa/musl-libc
$ sudo yum install -y git curl devtoolset-11 openssl-devel musl-gcc
$ source "/opt/rh/devtoolset-11/enable"
```

:::note

You may want to add that final `source` command to a `~/.profile`,
`~/.bashrc` / or `~/.bash_profile` equivalent, otherwise you must remember
to source that file prior to building `enarx`.

:::

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```sh:ID=debian ID=ubuntu
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y git curl gcc pkg-config libssl-dev musl-tools python3-minimal
```

:::tip

The minimum required `gcc` version is version 9. Something older _might_ build
binaries (such as integration test binaries), but may silently drop required
compiler flags. Please ensure you're using the minimum required version of `gcc`.
Failure to do so might result in weird failures at runtime.

:::

### Install Rust
```sh
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- --default-toolchain nightly -y
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
## Installing Enarx

You can install Enarx from GitHub, crates.io, or Nix.

### Install from GitHub
```sh:git;
$ git clone https://github.com/enarx/enarx
$ cd enarx/
$ cargo build

$ cargo install --bin enarx --path ./
```
### Install from crates.io

:::note

Rust version nightly-2022-04-11 is required when installing Enarx 0.4.0 from crates.io.

:::

```sh:crates;
$ rustup toolchain install nightly-2022-04-11 -t x86_64-unknown-linux-musl,x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,x86_64-unknown-none
$ CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_NONE_RUSTFLAGS="-C linker=gcc" cargo +nightly-2022-04-11 -Z bindeps install --bin enarx --version 0.4.0 -- enarx
```

### Install from Nix

Users with `nix` package manager installed (see https://nixos.org) should be able to just do in the checked out repository:
```sh:nix;
$ git clone https://github.com/enarx/enarx
$ cd enarx/
```
```sh:nix-legacy;
$ nix-shell
```
(on legacy, stable `nix` installs)

or:
```sh:nix-latest;
$ nix develop
```

:::note

`nix-shell` opens file descriptors `3` and `4` and the enarx `cargo test` fails therefore. `nix develop` does not seem to have this problem.

:::
## Running Enarx

### Build and run a WebAssembly module

Install the WebAssembly Rust toolchain:
```sh:helloworld;
$ rustup toolchain install nightly -t wasm32-wasi
```

Create a simple Rust program.  First make sure you're not in the repository you already created:
```sh:helloworld;
$ cd ~/
$ cargo init --bin hello-world
$ cd hello-world
$ echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello, Enarx!"); }' > src/main.rs
$ cargo +nightly build --release --target=wasm32-wasi
```

Assuming you did install the `enarx` binary and have it in your `$PATH`, you can
now run the WebAssembly program in an Enarx keep.
```sh:kvm-helloworld;
$ enarx run target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-world.wasm
```
```console
[â€¦]
Hello, Enarx!
```
If you want to suppress the debug output, add `2>/dev/null`.

### Select a Different Backend

`enarx` will probe the machine it is running on in an attempt to deduce an
appropriate deployment backend. To see what backends are supported on your
system, run:
```sh:kvm-backend,sgx-backend,snp-backend;
$ enarx info
```
You can manually select a backend with the `--backend` option, or by
setting the `ENARX_BACKEND` environment variable:

```sh:sgx-helloworld;
$ enarx run --backend=sgx target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-world.wasm
$ ENARX_BACKEND=sgx enarx run target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-world.wasm
```
##### Note about KVM backend

`enarx` will look for the kvm driver loaded by the kernel and will be ready to use if it's found. Linux kernel
automatically loads the kvm module if the virtualization feature is enabled by the hardware. The status of whether or not
enarx was able to find the driver can be checked with the command `enarx info`. If the output shows the driver for kvm is available, you are ready to use enarx using kvm backend.

When you execute the `enarx run` command, enarx tries to automatically select the appropriate driver, and kvm is automatically selected if it's the only backend available. But if you want to specifically use the kvm backend you can pass the `kvm` as a parameter to `--backend` option, or set the `ENARX_BACKEND` environment variable as `kvm`:

```sh:kvm-helloworld;
$ enarx run --backend=kvm target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-world.wasm
$ ENARX_BACKEND=kvm enarx run target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-world.wasm
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You were able to run Enarx successfully!

Enarx was built to be simple to use. It abstracts away complex concepts and supports multiple architectures transparently so that users don't have to worry about these.

Enarx provides a WebAssembly runtime, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python and Haskell.

Enarx is CPU-architecture independent, enabling the same application code to be deployed across multiple targets, abstracting issues such as cross-compilation and differing attestation mechanisms between hardware vendors.
