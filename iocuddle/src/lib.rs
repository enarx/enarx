//! `iocuddle` is a library for building runtime-safe `ioctl()` interfaces.
//!
//! Existing approaches to interfacing with `ioctl`s from Rust rely on casting
//! and/or unsafe code declarations at the call site. This moves the burden of
//! safety to the consumer of the `ioctl` interface, which is less than ideal.
//!
//! In contrast, `iocuddle` attempts to move the unsafe code burden to `ioctl`
//! definition. Once an `ioctl` is defined, all executions of that `ioctl` can
//! be done within safe code.
//!
//! # Interfaces
//!
//! `iocuddle` aims to handle >=99% of the kernel's `ioctl` interfaces.
//! However, we do not aim to handle all possible `ioctl` interfaces. We will
//! outline the different `ioctl` interfaces below.
//!
//! ## Classic Interfaces
//!
//! Classic `ioctl` interfaces are those `ioctl`s which were created before
//! the modern interfaces we will see below. They basically allowed the full
//! usage of the `ioctl` libc function which is defined as this:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::os::raw::{c_int, c_ulong};
//! extern "C" { fn ioctl(fd: c_int, request: c_ulong, ...) -> c_int; }
//! ```
//!
//! This interface can take any number of any type of arguments and can return
//! any positive integer (with `-1` reserved for indicating an error in
//! combination with `errno`).
//!
//! One major drawback of this interface is that it entirely punts on compiler
//! checking of type safety. A particular `request` is implicitly associated
//! with one or more types that are usually listed in the relevant `ioctl` man
//! page. If the programmer gets any of the types wrong, you end up with
//! corrupted memory.
//!
//! The problems with this interface were recognized early on. Therefore,
//! most `ioctl`s support only a single argument to reduce complexity. But
//! this does not solve the problem of the lack of compiler-enforced type
//! safety.
//!
//! `iocuddle` does not currently support `ioctl`s with multiple arguments.
//! Otherwise, classic `ioctl` interfaces can be defined and used via the
//! `Ioctl::classic()` constructor as follows:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::os::raw::{c_void, c_int, c_uint};
//! use iocuddle::*;
//!
//! let mut file = std::fs::File::open("/dev/tty").unwrap();
//!
//! // This is the simplist ioctl call. The request number is provided via the
//! // Ioctl::classic() constructor. This ioctl reads a C integer from the
//! // kernel by internally passing a reference to a c_int as the argument to
//! // the ioctl. This c_int is returned in the Ok status of the ioctl Result.
//! //
//! // Notice that since the state of the file descriptor is not modified via
//! // this ioctl, we define it using the Read parameter.
//! const TIOCINQ: Ioctl<Read, &c_int> = unsafe { Ioctl::classic(0x541B) };
//! assert_eq!(TIOCINQ.ioctl(&file).unwrap(), (0 as c_uint, 0 as c_int));
//!
//! // This ioctl is similar to the previous one. It differs in two important
//! // respects. First, this raw ioctl takes an input argument rather than an
//! // output argument. This raw argument is a C integer *NOT* a reference to
//! // a C integer. Second, since this ioctl modifies the state of the file
//! // descriptor we use Write instead of Read.
//! //
//! // Notice that the return value of the TCSBRK.ioctl() call is the positive
//! // integer returned from the raw ioctl(), unlike the previous example. It
//! // is not the input argument type.
//! const TCSBRK: Ioctl<Write, c_int> = unsafe { Ioctl::classic(0x5409) };
//! assert_eq!(TCSBRK.ioctl(&mut file, 0).unwrap(), 0 as c_uint);
//!
//! // `iocuddle` can also support classic ioctls with no argument. These
//! // always modify the file descriptor state, so the Write parameter is
//! // used.
//! const TIOCSBRK: Ioctl<Write, c_void> = unsafe { Ioctl::classic(0x5427) };
//! const TIOCCBRK: Ioctl<Write, c_void> = unsafe { Ioctl::classic(0x5428) };
//! assert_eq!(TIOCSBRK.ioctl(&mut file).unwrap(), 0);
//! assert_eq!(TIOCCBRK.ioctl(&mut file).unwrap(), 0);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Modern Interfaces
//!
//! In order to alleviate the type-safety problem with the classic interfaces,
//! the Linux kernel developed a new set of conventions for developing
//! `ioctl`s. We call these conventions the modern interface.
//!
//! Modern `ioctl` interfaces always take a single reference to a struct or
//! integer and return `-1` on failure and `0` (or occasionally another
//! positive integer) on success. The `ioctl` request number is constructed
//! from four parameters:
//!   * a `group` (confusingly called `type` in the kernel macros)
//!   * a `nr` (number)
//!   * a `direction`
//!   * (the size of) a `type`
//!
//! The `group` parameter is used as a namespace to group related `ioctl`s.
//! It is an integer value.
//!
//! The `nr` parameter is an integer discriminator to uniquely identify the
//! `ioctl` within the `group`.
//!
//! The `direction` parameter identifies which direction the data flows. If the
//! data flows from userspace to the kernel, this is the `write` `direction`.
//! If data flows from the kernel to userspace, this is the `read` `direction`.
//! Data which flows both ways is tagged with the `write/read` `direction`.
//!
//! The `type` parameter identifies the type that should be used with this
//! `ioctl`. In the kernel C code this type is only directly used to perturb
//! the `ioctl` request number with the size of the type. `iocuddle`
//! additionally uses this parameter to provide type safety.
//!
//! Defining modern `ioctl`s using `iocuddle` looks like this:
//!
//! ```
//! use iocuddle::*;
//!
//! // Define the Group of KVM ioctls.
//! const KVM: Group = Group::new(0xAE);
//!
//! // Define ioctls within the KVM group.
//! //
//! // The nr is passed to the direction-specific constructor.
//! const KVM_PPC_ALLOCATE_HTAB: Ioctl<WriteRead, &u32> = unsafe { KVM.write_read(0xa7) };
//! const KVM_X86_GET_MCE_CAP_SUPPORTED: Ioctl<Read, &u64> = unsafe { KVM.read(0x9d) };
//! const KVM_X86_SETUP_MCE: Ioctl<Write, &u64> = unsafe { KVM.write(0x9c) };
//! ```
//!

//!
//! For the kernel documentation of the ioctl process, see the following file
//! in the kernel source tree: `Documentation/userspace-api/ioctl/ioctl-number.rst`
