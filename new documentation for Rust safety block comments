// SAFETY: This function assumes that `self` is a valid non-null pointer to a `MyStruct` object and that `self` is not modified while the function is executing.
//
// Rationale: We assume `self` is valid because it is created by the caller and is guaranteed to be non-null.
// We also assume `self` is not modified because this function only reads data from `self`.

    fn get_data(&self) -> &Data {
