**About**
Tell us a bit about yourself! How did you find the project? What's your favorite IT Crowd episode? etc.

**Skills**
Tell us a bit about your background: what skills you have, relevant prior
experience, etc. Don't copy-paste your entire resume -- this is not an
interview! We just need enough to get the ball rolling.

**Interest areas**
Are there any particular parts of the project you would like to contribute to?
