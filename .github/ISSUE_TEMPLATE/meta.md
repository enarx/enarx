    - [ ] Make sure WiFi works
- [ ] Watch the IT Crowd
    - [ ] Put this over with the rest of the fire 
    - [ ] Turn it off and on again (#abc)

**Organization**
If you have the appropriate repo permissions, please don't forget:
- Properly label your issue and place it in the appropriate project.
- If you assign yourself or someone else, please ensure the project status is updated to "Assigned".

Finally, please delete any template boilerplate before submitting!
