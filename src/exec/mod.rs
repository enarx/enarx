// FUTURE: right now we only have one exec, `enarx-exec-wasmtime`.
// In the future there may be other workload types - in theory we can run
// any static PIE ELF binary. We could have a Lua interpreter, or a
// JavaScript interpreter, or whatever.
// So there's two parts to this trait - call them KeepSetup and Engine.
//
// KeepSetup is the part that actually sets up the Keep for the Workload,
// which might involve setting up network sockets, storage devices, etc.
// This part must be implemented by any Exec, since we want the
// Enarx environment to be platform-agnostic.
//
// Engine is the (exec-specific) portion that actually interprets or
// executes the workload. It's responsible for taking the sockets / devices
// etc. that were set up by KeepSetup and making them usable in a way that
// the workload will understand.
//
// So: someday we might want to split this into two traits, and we might
// have multiple Execs for different languages/environments, and we
// might need to examine the workload and determine which Exec is
// the right one to use. But first... we gotta make exec-wasmtime work.
