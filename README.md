# Enarx

## Introduction
Enarx is an application deployment system enabling applications to run within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) without rewriting for particular platforms or SDKs. It handles attestation and delivery into a run-time “Keep” based on WebAssembly, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation. Enarx is CPU-architecture independent, enabling the same application code to be deployed across multiple targets, abstracting issues such as cross-compilation and differing attestation mechanisms between hardware vendors. Work is currently underway on AMD SEV and Intel SGX.

We've known for a long time that we need encryption for data at rest and in transit: Enarx helps you do encryption for data as well as algorithms in use.

## Project aim
Create a way to create and run "private, fungible, serverless" applications using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). In other words, to provide a platform abstraction for TEEs.

They should:

 * be confidential from the host and other workloads;
 * be able to run on
   * multiple silicon architectures;
   * multiple server types;
   * public cloud or private cloud;
 * employ serverless deployment and execution mechanisms.

The mechanism itself should be capable of being FIPS-certified.

## Getting Started

### Building

To build Enarx:

1. Install [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make):

```
$ cargo install cargo-make
```

2. Build Enarx:

```
$ cargo make build
```

3. You can optionally run tests:

```
$ cargo make test
```

### More Information

For more information, please try our [wiki](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/wiki), which includes further details on how to get more information.  It's also where we plan to keep up-to-date project information.

Building the various components of Enarx is currently complex: we are working on this.  Please contact us for help.

(2020-01-01) It is also worth mentioning that it isn't yet possible to run Enarx.  We're working hard on it and we'd love people to work with us. We hope to be adding more information very soon, to allow you to get started.
